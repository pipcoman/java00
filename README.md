2. Run "cmd.exe" from Start menu (in windows) or a terminal session (not in windows)
3. Go to the path where Hello.java is
4. Run  HelloWorld with this command "java Helloworld world" (java \<Class name\> \<parameter\>)
5. "Hello, world!" will appeare !!!!

If there is some error check the [F.A.Q.](faq.txt) to find some hint ;-)
