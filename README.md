# java00

This is your first java lesson. 
In this lesson we will write a program (a java Class) that will print out "Hello, world!"
Download HelloWorld.java
Run "cmd.exe" from Start menu (in windows) or a terminal session (not in windows)
Go to the path where HelloWorld.java is
Run  HelloWorld with this command "java Helloworld"
"Hello, world!" will appare. If there is some error check the F.A.Q. to find some hint ;-) ?
